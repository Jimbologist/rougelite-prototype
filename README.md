# rougelite-prototype
 A simple prototype for a rougelite game I made for the purpose of creating something on my own. Just a quick learning experience for improving my Unity skills and creating larger back-end systems like level generation, stats, re-usable pathfinding, tilemaps, interactions, and a weapon system with unique architecture.
